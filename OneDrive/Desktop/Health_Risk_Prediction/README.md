# Health Risk Classification

## Overview
This project uses **Supervised Machine Learning ** to classify individuals as **Healthy** or **Unhealthy** based on physiological, lifestyle, and medical attributes.

## Problem Statement
Build a robust classification model to distinguish between low-risk and high-risk individuals using health-related features.

## Dataset Summary
- **Records:** 9,800 individuals  
- **Features:** Numerical & categorical  
- **Target:** Healthy vs Unhealthy

## Best Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Why Random Forest?**
  - Handles non-linear relationships
  - Works well with mixed data types
  - Reduces overfitting using ensemble learning
    
##  Workflow
1. Data preprocessing & encoding  
2. Feature scaling  
3. Train–test split  
4. Model training (Logistic Regression (with Regularization), KNN, Random Forest Classifier ,Gradient Boosting Classifier, Voting Classifier)  
5. Model evaluation

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

## Outcome
Random Forest successfully separates healthy and unhealthy profiles with strong classification performance.
